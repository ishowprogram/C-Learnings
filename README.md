# C++ Learning Journey

This repository contains my C++ learning progress and practice files. Here you'll find various examples and exercises as I learn C++ programming concepts.

## Basic C++ Concepts
- Variables and Data Types
- Operators and Expressions
- Control Flow (if-else)
- Loops (while, do-while, for)
- Pointers
- Arrays
- Pattern Programming
- Number System Conversions

## Assignment Solutions

### Assignment 1: Beginning with C++
1. Find Factorial of a Number
2. Check if Number is Prime
3. Basic Calculator Operations
4. Find Largest and Smallest of 3 Numbers
5. Print Multiplication Table
6. Generate First n Fibonacci Numbers
7. Reverse a Number
8. Operators using Switch Case
9. Print ABCD Pattern
10. Print Star Pattern
11. Decimal to Binary Conversion

Each solution demonstrates understanding of basic C++ concepts including:
